# Introduction
The iPot project main purpose is to bring a simple solution to take care of the home plants. Not
everyone takes the proper care of their plants, some people always forget to water them or to
give them enough sunlight. That’s why the iPot project will show the user the room
temperature, room humidity, soil humidity and sunlight level. To make it even easier, the user
can connect their own phone or computer to the iPot via WiFi and check the interface using the
browser.
